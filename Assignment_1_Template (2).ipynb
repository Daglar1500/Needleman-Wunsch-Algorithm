    "In the first part, you will implement the Needleman-Wunsch pairwise sequence alignment algorithm. The algorithm must be implemented with a linear gap penalty. It should take two amino acid sequences, a gap penalty and a scoring matrix as input and should output the maximum alignment score of these sequences and the alignment achieving this maximum score. If there are multiple optimal alignments, the algorithm should output any one of them. For the scoring matrix (match and mismatch), please use the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix."
